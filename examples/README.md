## [ðŸ’» Donald Trump Tweets Generator](https://github.com/the-new-sky/Kadot/blob/master/examples/trump_generator.py)
In this example, we use MarkovGenerator (the Kadot implementation of [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) on [Donald Trump tweets archive](https://github.com/bpb27/trump-tweet-archive)) to imitate Donald Trump tweets.

As you can see, that's quite funny to use :

```
    ---------------------------
    I will be allowed to hide!
    ---------------------------
    I don't wait!"
    ---------------------------
    While I always complaining about me!
    ---------------------------
    Obama's happening!
    ---------------------------
```
