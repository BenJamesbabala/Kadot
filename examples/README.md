## Trump generator
In this example, we use MarkovGenerator on [Donald Trump tweets archive](https://github.com/bpb27/trump-tweet-archive) to imitate Donald Trump tweets.

As you can see, that's quite funny to use :

```
    ---------------------------
    I will be allowed to hide!
    ---------------------------
    I don't wait!"
    ---------------------------
    While I always complaining about me!
    ---------------------------
    Obama's happening!
    ---------------------------

```
